"""Cross-platform drop-in for the POSIX ``fcntl.flock`` API used across R20.

On Linux/macOS this module simply re-exports the real ``fcntl`` lock API.
On Windows (which has no ``fcntl``), ``flock()`` is emulated with
``msvcrt.locking`` over the first byte of the lock file. A contended
non-blocking lock raises ``BlockingIOError`` exactly like POSIX
``LOCK_NB`` does — callers rely on that to detect a running cycle.

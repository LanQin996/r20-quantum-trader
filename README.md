## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xethanq/astra-quant-agent.git && cd astra-quant-agent
./setup.sh                  # Interactive onboarding wizard (recommended)
# Container launch: ./deploy/docker-start.sh | Bare-metal: ./deploy/install.sh && ./start.sh
```

| Service Surface | Local Access URL | Role & Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Trading Workstation** | `http://localhost:8080/trading` | Real-time position HUD & factor telemetry |
| **Admin Control Plane** | `http://localhost:8080/admin/login` | Risk settings, prompt studio, API keys |
| **API Documentation** | `http://localhost:8080/docs` | OpenAPI schema & endpoint specifications |

> **Fail-Closed Default**: AstraQuant boots in **paper trading mode (`demo`)** by default. Live execution is physically blocked until exchange credentials are provided and validated via read-only balance snapshots.

---

## Exchange Referral & Fee Rebates

> **Trading API Compatibility Notice**: AstraQuant's autonomous execution engine **only supports OKX native API**. Binance and Gate.io are community partner links provided solely for registration discounts and fee rebates; our automated trading system does not support direct API execution on other exchanges.

| Exchange | Role & Compatibility | Referral Link | Code | Special Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OKX** | **Native Trading Supported** (Official Engine Target) | [Register on OKX](https://www.mitxcqvwnhj.com/join/48039151) | `48039151` | Supports new accounts & **dormant accounts (inactive > 180 days)** |

## Core Principles

1. **Hypothesis vs. Enforcement**: LLMs analyze market structure and propose order intents; deterministic Python code holds absolute veto authority over leverage, position sizing, and stop-loss placements.
2. **Multi-Perspective Synthesis**: Specialized analytical seats (Macro, Trend, Microstructure, Contrarian) independently assess each cycle to mitigate single-model bias.
3. **Exchange-Native Protection**: Every filled order is immediately hedged on the exchange side with native conditional OCO brackets (TP1 partial scale-out + TP2 runner + stop-loss).

---

## System Architecture

AstraQuant executes on a 15-minute trading cycle across four decoupled boundaries:

```text
1. Market Ingestion & Factors    ──> CVD, Orderbook Imbalance (OBI), Funding Rate, Options IV Skew, VWAP
2. Multi-Model Council (LLMs)   ──> Macro, Trend, and Microstructure seats analyze & synthesize order intent
3. Python Physical Risk Gates   ──> Sizing clamps, R:R floor verification, same-direction cap, circuit breaker
4. OKX Execution & Cloud OCO    ──> Passive BBO Maker limits, scale-out TP legs, and 100% cloud stop-loss
```

---

## Market Microstructure Factors

Rather than relying purely on lagging indicators, AstraQuant continuously calculates derivative market metrics:

| Dimension | Key Metrics | Role in Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Order Flow & Taker Delta** | Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) Divergence, Whale Taker Flow | Identifies aggressive buying or selling absorbing passive liquidity |
| **Orderbook Microstructure** | Order Book Imbalance (OBI), Top-20 L2 Depth Asymmetry | Measures instantaneous book liquidity and bid/ask resistance |
| **Settlement & Open Interest** | Funding Rate Velocity, Open Interest (OI) Acceleration | Gauges leverage crowding and liquidation vulnerability |
| **Volatility Surface** | Implied Volatility (IV) Skew, Max Pain Strike Distance | Evaluates market tail-risk expectations and institutional hedging |
| **Structural Benchmarks** | Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP ±1σ / ±2σ), VPVR POC | Locates institutional fair-value zones and mean-reversion boundaries |
| **Trend & Momentum** | MACD Histogram Velocity & Acceleration, ADX Vector | Distinguishes trend continuation from exhaustion chop |

---

## Multi-Model Analysis & Prompt Caching

- **Specialized Seats**: Configurable models (DeepSeek-V3/R1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Qwen) evaluate distinct domains (Macro, Microstructure, Momentum, Contrarian Risk).
- **Consensus Arbitration**: Configurable modes include *Paranoid Veto* (unconditional downgrade to WAIT on severe anomaly), *Weighted Majority*, or *Alpha Momentum*.
- **Prompt Caching Architecture**:
  - Over 90% of the prompt context consists of static doctrine, risk rules, and multi-symbol factor matrices.
  - Council seats broadcast over this shared prefix with session affinity, achieving sub-second Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and significantly reducing LLM API token costs.

---

## Capital Management & Risk Control

Risk rules are enforced strictly by Python code (`scripts/risk_constants.py`). Baseline parameters:

| Parameter | Baseline Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Max Concurrent Positions** | `6` positions | Upper limit of active open positions across all instruments |
| **Max Same-Direction Positions** | `4` positions | Prevents directional over-exposure during market-wide correlated moves |
| **Max Single-Asset Margin** | `Equity × 30%` | Prevents concentration risk in a single coin |
| **Intraday Drawdown Breaker** | `min(150 USDT, Equity × 5%)` | Halts new entries for 24h if daily drawdown threshold is breached |
| **Dynamic Leverage Clamp** | `2.0x – 5.0x` | Clamped to instrument ATR and liquidity limits |
| **Minimum Reward:Risk (R:R)** | `R:R ≥ 2.0` | Prohibits low-expectancy trades; requires favorable risk-reward |
| **Time Invalidation Stop** | `4.0 hours` | Closes stagnant positions that fail to expand within the expected window |
| **Cloud Stop-Loss Coverage** | `100%` | Every position is covered by exchange-side cloud conditional orders |

## Deploy

> 💡 **Cloud Server Security Group & Port Notice**:
> When deploying on a cloud VPS (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, Alibaba Cloud, etc.), verify inbound firewall rules in your cloud console:
> - **8080 (TCP Inbound)**: AstraQuant Trading Workstation & Admin Plane;
> - **22 (TCP Inbound)**: SSH remote access and server operations;
> - **443 (TCP Outbound)**: OKX V5 REST API & LLM gateway connectivity.
>
> ⚠️ **API Security Redline**: OKX API Key requires only **Read** and **Trade** permissions. **Never enable Withdrawal permissions**. IP binding to your static server IP is strongly advised.

| **Trade Review** | [`docs/analysis.md`](docs/analysis.md) | Fork-specific trade replay, analysis archive, and export |

The fork uses a single container built locally by `docker compose up -d --build`. The backend supervises the gateway worker; do not start a second gateway container. Before upgrading an existing R20 installation, stop it, back up `.env` and `data/`, rename legacy `R20_*` environment keys to `ASTRA_*`, then run `python scripts/migrate_r20_to_astra.py --check` and `--apply` if required. See [`docs/analysis-archive-operations.md`](docs/analysis-archive-operations.md) for the optional independent archive job.

**Continuous Governance Gates:**

| Gate | Scope & Protection |
|---|---|
| [`tests/audit/test_directory_docs_current.py`](tests/audit/test_directory_docs_current.py) | Ensures all modules are registered in `__init__.py` and documented |
| [`tests/core/test_readme_baseline_numbers.py`](tests/core/test_readme_baseline_numbers.py) | Keeps test count baselines aligned with actual test suites |
| [`tests/audit/test_doc_paths_are_committed.py`](tests/audit/test_doc_paths_are_committed.py) | Ensures all source paths referenced in documentation exist and are tracked |

---

## Brand & Namespace Governance

- **Public Brand**: **AstraQuant** — <https://www.astraquant.tech>
- **Internal Namespace**: **`astra`** (packages `astra_backend`, `astra_gateway`; configuration prefix `ASTRA_*`)

### Intentional Legacy Markers — Do Not Rename

Three historical markers are intentionally preserved to protect live production state and open positions (`tests/audit/test_brand_strings_are_consistent.py`):
1. **Exchange leg tags `t-r20sl*` / `t-r20tp*`**: Open orders placed prior to namespace upgrade remain live on exchange matching engines. Preserved so cloud ratchets maintain tracking; new orders use `astrasl` / `astratp`.
2. **Encrypted backup magic `R20GCM2` + NUL**: Historic backups must remain decryptable. New archives use `ASTRAGCM`.
3. **`cpa.r20.cn` in test fixtures**: The maintainer's internal DNS gateway for upstream LLM routing, not a repository namespace.
